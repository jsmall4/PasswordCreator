# PasswordCreator

# Password Creator, by: Jack Smallwood. This is my third project for the University of Birmingham Full Stack Developement course. The assignment came with starter code and the assignment was to create a functioning password generator. In which the user could choose the password length and to include or disclude any lowercase, uppercase, numbers or symbols. With a minmium value of 8 characters and max of 128.

# Built HTML, CSS & JavaScript

# Motivation: The page should use clean JavaScript code to create logic, functions and alert windows. To dynamically update the HTML & CSS.

# Actions taken: Created array elements in a string to contain all the character values in the password. Used Const for this as they won't change. Created the functions (generatePassword & writePassword) and logic needed to ensure the password criteria is met, the user has a choice of what it can contain and how long, then displaying the password.

# Problems solved: the application now functions and displayed a unique password of the users criteria.
